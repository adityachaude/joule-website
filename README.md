# joule-website
Joule is a responsive website built using semantic HTML and Tailwind CSS. It is designed with a clean, modern layout and a mobile-first approach, ensuring seamless performance across all screen sizes. 
The site includes structured sections for showcasing content, intuitive navigation, and reusable components styled with Tailwind utilities. 
This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development, responsive design, and creating visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces.
